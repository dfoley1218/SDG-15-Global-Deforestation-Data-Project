# SDG-15-Global-Deforestation-Data
SQL Project utilizing the SDG 15 Global Deforestation data set.

Between the years 2000 and 2020, the global forest area coverage has declined by 2.4%. That's about 100 million hectares of land in only 20 years. Unfortunately, these processes have a direct effect on accelerating climate change and threaten biodiversity. As a former biologist, these data are incredibly concerning to me, and as a result I decided to create a visual representation of this forest loss utilizing the SDG 15 Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals data set. Here, I utilized SQL to answer some of these key questions and then map those changes in a Tableau Dashboard.
 
  
- What are the top ten nations with the most dramatic forest loss in 20 years?
- What are the top ten nations with the greatest upward trend of forest growth?
- What percentage of countries that have been able to increase or decrease their forest coverage over a 20 year span?
- What is the total area of land mass of deforested land accounted for globally between 2000 and 2020?
- Utilizing an ISO 3166 country codes external table, which regions of the earth had the least and most deforestation? What is the average trend for each region?
